## Overview

![screenshot](./desktop-preview.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

-   What was your experience?
    -   This project was really annoying to complete because I tried implementing a search bar's functionality all through React and state management so the state quickly became quite complex. In the future, I would most likely switch out this functionality for something more robust and reliable like the built-in indexing functionality that come with big name databases such as Redis.
-   What have you learned/improved?
    -   I learned a lot about state and how I can use the `useReducer` hook to manage more complex states.
